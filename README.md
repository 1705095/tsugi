TSUGI - A Framework for Building PHP-Based Learning Tools
=========================================================

This project is in early days.  Its goal is to build a scalable
multi-tenant "tool" hosting environment based on the emerging IMS
standards.  

If you want to see this code actually working, you can play online:

You can log in to this site and request an account to use with your IMS
LTI Compatible LMS.  Once you have a key/secret to use the system, here
is some rudimentatry LTI 1.0 documentation:

* [Configuring LTI 1.0 Launches](docs/LAUNCHING.md)
