Welcome to the www.tsugi.org project.  This project is in early days.  Its goal is 
to build a scalable multi-tenant "tool" hosting environment based on the 
emerging IMS standards.  

Here are several other pages describing this project:

* Installing Tsugi: [Documentation](docs/INSTALL.md) ([Video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na_QDXp-Y7o&index=1&list=PLlRFEj9H3Oj5WZUjVjTJVBN18ozYSWMhw))
* [Developer Documentation](docs/DEVELOP.md)
* [About The Project](docs/ABOUT.md)

If you want to see this code actually working, you can play online:

You can log in to this site and request an account to use with your IMS
LTI compatible LMS.  Once you have a key/secret to use the system, here
is some rudimentary LTI 1.0 documentation:
