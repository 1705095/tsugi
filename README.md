TSUGI - A Framework for Building PHP-Based Learning Tools
=========================================================

**Note:** Branch 0.2.0 is taken before we start removing folders like mod, exercises, and static so this truly becomes the 
developer / admin console.   This branch is to allow legacy servers to be maintained that expect all theise pieces to come 
down in a single checkout.

Welcome to the www.tsugi.org project. 
Its goal is to build a scalable multi-tenant "tool" hosting environment based on the 
emerging IMS standards.
