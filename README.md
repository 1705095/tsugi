TSUGI - A Framework for Building PHP-Based Learning Tools
=========================================================

This project is in early days.  Its goal is to build a scalable
multi-tenant "tool" hosting environment based on the emerging IMS
standards.  

Here are several other pages describing this project:

* [Installing Tsugi](docs/INSTALL.md)
* [Developer Documentation](docs/DEVELOP.md)
* [About The Project](docs/ABOUT.md)

If you want to see this code actually working, you can play online:

* https://lti-tools.dr-chuck.com/tsugi/

You can log in to this site and request an account to use with your IMS
LTI compatible LMS.  Once you have a key/secret to use the system, here
is some rudimentary LTI 1.0 documentation:
