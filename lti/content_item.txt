Bestt documentation on how it works is here:

https://www.eduappcenter.com/docs/extensions/content

I believe you already have a canvas account and you can install 
a tool in any course you have or create. If you want to be able 
to see it in action, you can install this tool:

http://lti-tool-provider.herokuapp.com/

it links to its xml config on that page, it is here:

http://lti-tool-provider.herokuapp.com/tool_config.xml

The trick in that xml is the block: <lticm:options name="editor_button">

That is what makes a button appear in the RCE. The other option of 
interest to you there is selection for module items which is 
'resource_selection'. We don't have an UI components to enable those placements. 

These 2 pages show how to configure it in Canvas:

If you need more details let me know.
